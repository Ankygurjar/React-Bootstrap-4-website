import React, {Component} from 'react'
import Image1 from '../Images/image1.jpeg'
import Links from './links'

export default class Home extends Component{
  render(){
    return(
      <div>
      <Links />
      <div className="container">
        <h1>Welcome to home page</h1>
        <img className="bannerPic" src={Image1}/>
        <p>Depends where you want the link to go. If it's for
        internal app navigation, then the routing library will
         likely have a  component that will do this for
          you, otherwise you will have to just use css to
          style it like a link. But again I would suggest
          making an independent component to do this. â€“ Phil
