import React, {Component} from 'react'

        <h3>About Page</h3>
        <img className="bannerPic" src={Image}/>
        <p>This is about page</p>
        <p>Depends where you want the link to go. If it's for
        internal app navigation, then the routing library will
         likely have a component that will do this for
          you, otherwise you will have to just use css to
          style it like a link. But again I would suggest
          making an independent component to do this. â€“ Phil
